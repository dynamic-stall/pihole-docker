## BLUF: This script will create a custom Docker network for your container(s). You can use the preset values, or choose your favorite IP scheme.

## MACVLAN SETUP (OPTIONAL):      (example script at the end)
## If you would like to use an existing IP address on your home network for management purposes, you can go with a macvlan network setup:
## To do so, change the DRIVER variable below (line 21) from "bridge" to "macvlan".
## Next, ensure the SUBNET and GATEWAY variables match those of your home network settings (check the LAN settings of your router, if you aren't sure).
## Finally, un-comment the IP_RANGE lines below (22 and 29) and enter in an IP range on line 20 (this step requires a bit of CIDR knowledge).
## (choose an IP range that isn't too restrictive and won't cause IP conflicts with other network devices. I recommend using a chunk from the latter half of your IP pool; i.e., x.x.x.128/25)

## You'll need to modify the docker-compose.yml file next:
## If going with MACVLAN, comment out or delete line 35, referencing the Web Admin UI port; you no longer need it.
## Next (or "First," if sticking with bridge network), change lines 22 and 54, referencing the Cloudflared and Pi-hole container IPs, to any available IP addresses on your bridge/home network (within the set IP range, if going with MACVLAN).
## Lastly, follow the remaining instructions at the end of the docker-compose.yml file for any remaining configs not described here.
